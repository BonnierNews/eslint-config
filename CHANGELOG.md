# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Added support for ES6 module linting, extending from `eslint-config-exp/modules`.
- To allow the test config to extend both CommonJS and ES6 modules, its explicit inheritance from the base config
  has been removed, to instead rely on the users defined base config. This will also allow for simpler overrides
  in a project using these configurations, since they will be correctly inherited into tests.

## 0.1.1

Consistent spacing for functions and code blocks.

## 0.1.0

New rules to format objects: either all properties on the same line OR use multiline.

Behavior remains unchanged.
